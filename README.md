# bokeh_flask_example
This example is intended to document a very simple web app that shows a bokeh plot.
The web app runs using flask.
The bokeh plot is the basic example plot coming from http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/quickstart.html#sample-data.

## Goal
1. show a basic webpage with a bokeh plot
2. change the color of the graphs based on the <col>  attribute in the url eg. http://localhost:5000/plot/<col>
